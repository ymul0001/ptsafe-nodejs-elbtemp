## 1. Overview

The PTSafe backend is created in order to support the main functionalities that are covered in the PTSafe mobile application (can be found here in [PTSafe mobile](https://github.com/ymul0001/ptsafe-mobile)). It consists of two main backend framework developed on top of Flask and NodeJS, and it is connected to the data source Amazon Web Services (AWS) RDS. While the Flask API is utilised to expose the crowd detection model, the NodeJS-Express API is utilised to expose the main data source for the application. To support the deployment process, both backend APIs are served in Heroku [link](https://id.heroku.com/login) Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) hosting service.

## 2. Software Architecture and Design Principle Involved
### 2.1. Backend for the main software functionality
The back-end part of the application is established by using a NodeJS API framework called ExpressJS. It is expected at this point that all API endpoint creation is generated by using a functional programming paradigm rather than Object-Oriented Principle (OOP) to speed up the development process. 

Second, the NodeJS API is built by strictly following the Model-View-Controller approach (although the View part is changed by Routes). By implementing this approach, the data sources are mapped first in a form of models, and all the JSON responses generated are mapped into each model’s parameter. After that, the logical part of the application is implemented inside controllers, which each controller calls each respective models for each API endpoint. After that, the controllers are registered inside several API routes, and it will be eventually exposed to the public in a form of URL.

Meanwhile, the main back-end API is also built by following the SOLID design principle, particularly the single responsibility principle. It is reflected on the current software architecture code that implements different controller classes for different types of API endpoints.

### 2.2. Backend for the main software functionality
The object detection back-end is built with a python API framework called Flask.  To create this back-end, the functional programming paradigm is also utilised, which takes the computer vision model generated by the AI division and exposed it in a form of API endpoints. There is no specific software architecture principle being involved in this back-end, as currently it only has one specific endpoint to receive the image from the mobile application and feed it into the model.
